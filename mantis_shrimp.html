  <p>
    The mantis shrimp has the strongest punch (pound for pound) in the animal kingdom. Their eyes can also see cancer cells. There are two different types of mantis shrimp: ones that spear their food with their appendages, and ones that punch their food. The diet of mantis shrimps who spear their food consists of soft creatures such as fish. Meanwhile, the diet of the shrimp that punch their food consists of animals such as snails or other shelled crustaceans.
