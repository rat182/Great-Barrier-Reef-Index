This repo was originally made on replit, as part of a hackathon with a 4 person team. Although it took us a few hours to come up with any ideas related to the 3 prompts
(water, depth, and sci-fi), we eventually managed to make this website as part of the 'depth' theme. The finished website includes: a homepage with 6 javascript buttons, 
6 seperate pages for each respective animal, and a home button on each page designed by our team. All components were made with: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Finally, we 
were able to take advantage of replit's IDE to create a completed website. The link to the aforementioned website is located at the top of the read me. Overall, I think
I speak for everyone when I say I learned a great deal throughout this project. Although being a beginner to the field of computer science, all 4 of us were able to learn a lot about front-end web development. If I were to repeat this project, I think I would definetly slot out some time to work on the backend of the website.
